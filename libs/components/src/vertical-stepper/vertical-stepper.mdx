## UI Component

The UI component consists of a couple of elements.

- `bit-table`: The main component that creates a native table element and applies the table styling.
- `header`: A container for the table header.
- `body`: A container for the table body.
- `bitCell`: A cell within the table. Used for both headers and content.
