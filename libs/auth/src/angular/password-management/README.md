# Master Password Management Flows

The Auth Team manages several components that allow a user to either:

1. Set an initial master password
2. Change an existing master password

This document maps all of our password management flows to the components that handle them.

<ul>
  <li>MP = "master password"</li>
  <li>MPE = "master password ecryption"</li>
  <li>TDE = "trusted device encryption"</li>
  <li>JIT Provisioned = "just-in-time provisioned"</li>
</ul>

## The Base `InputPasswordComponent`

Central to our master password management flows is the base [InputPasswordComponent](https://components.bitwarden.com/?path=/docs/auth-input-password--docs), which is responsible for displaying the appropriate form fields, performing form validation, and generating appropriate cryptographic properties for each flow. This keeps our UI, validation, and key generation consistent across all master password management flows.

\* A note on JIT provisioned user flows:

- Even though a JIT provisioned user is a brand-new user who was ‚Äújust‚Äù created, we consider them to be an ‚Äúexisting authed user‚Äù _from the perspective of the set-password flow_. This is because at the time they set their initial password, their account already exists in the database (before setting their password) and they have already authenticated via SSO.
- The same is not true in the _Account Registration_ flows above‚Äîthat is, during account registration when a user reaches the `/finish-signup` or `/trial-initiation` page to set their initial password, their account does not yet exist in the database, and will only be created once they set an initial password.
