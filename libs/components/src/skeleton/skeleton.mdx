# Skeleton Loading

The skeleton component can be used as an alternative loading indicator to the spinner by mimicking
the content that will be loaded such as text, images, or video. It can be used to represent layout
components as well, but should not be used for interactive elements like form controls or buttons.

## Skeleton Loading Components

There are three components that can be used to create a skeleton loading page.

### Skeleton

Basic skeleton loading component that can be used to represent content that is loading. Use for
non-text shapes.

#### Customizing

The basic skeleton component is fully customizable in shape and edge appearance to allow consumers
to more accurately represent the content.

**Inputs**

| Input       | Description                                         | Accepted options | Default |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| `edgeShape` | configure whether corners are fully rounded or boxy | `box`, `circle`  | `box`   |

**Classes**

Customize the shape's size by applying tailwind size classes to the `bit-skeleton` element (example
`tw-h-3 tw-w-12`). Please refer to the tailwind docs for all height/width options, and note that
custom values are possible with tailwind as well.

<Canvas of={skeletonStories.Square} />
<Canvas of={skeletonStories.Circle} />

### Skeleton Text

Specific skeleton component used to represent lines of text.

#### Customizing

The number of lines of text in the skeleton is configurable.

**Inputs**

| Input   | Description                                   | Accepted options | Default |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| `lines` | configure how many lines of text are rendered | any `number`     | `1`     |

<Canvas of={skeletonTextStories.Text} />
<Canvas of={skeletonTextStories.TextMultiline} />

### Skeleton Group

Arranges skeleton loaders into a pre-arranged group that mimics the table and item components.

#### Customizing

**Slots**

Use the following slots to render `<bit-skeleton>` and/or `bit-skeleton-text` elements.

| Slot           | Description                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `slot="start"` | content that should appear horizontally before the default content; will not grow to fill space |
| default        | main content area; grows to fill the horizontal space                                           |
| `slot="end"`   | content that should appear horizontally after the default content; will not grow to fill space  |

<Canvas of={skeletonGroupStories.Default} />

## Display Considerations

For pages that load quickly, we want to avoid the skeleton flashing in and out. To avoid this, we
recommend the following display guidelines:

- After the loading is initiated (by page load or by user action), wait 1 second to display the
  skeleton loader.
- After waiting 1s, render the loading skeleton.
- Ideally the skeleton disappears after 10 seconds, but we do not enforce a max duration. Add a max
  duration at your discretion.

## Accessibility

Because there are typically multiple skeleton loaders present on a page that is using skeleton
loading, the individual skeleton loaders should not announce themselves or be present to
screenreaders, as this would overwhelm the user with multiple identical announcements. Thus, the
skeleton components are hidden from screenreaders.

Instead, the recommended strategy is to use a page-level announcement for screenreaders:

- We recommend using the
  [Angular CDK LiveAnnouncer](https://material.angular.dev/cdk/a11y/overview#liveannouncer) to first
  announce that content is loading when the skeleton loader is displayed, and then to announce that
  content has loaded. The announcements should be localized, and the politeness level should be set
  to `polite`.

- Alternatively, you may wish to render your own `role="status"` element or a custom `aria-live`
  region in the template to accomplish the announcements detailed above.

## Example with Browser Extension

components, check the
